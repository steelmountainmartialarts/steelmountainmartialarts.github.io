                <p>
                    Welcome to Steel Mountain Martial Arts, we are a small personalized facility that specializes in 
                    stand up martial arts,our base martial art is Kenpo Karate, within the classes we also mix in 
                    elements of a few other martial arts such as kick boxing along with Wu Shu better known as 
                    Chinese Kung fu.<br /><br />
                    We pride ourselves on being a family friendly dojo, our classes consist of a maximum of twelve 
                    adults at one time or fifteen children. Our head instructor began training in Kenpo Karate back in 
                    the late 1980’s, after receiving his Black belt in 1993. He chose to dabble in a few other martial 
                    arts over the years for a better understanding of what different styles of martial arts can offer. 
                    Our classes have a strong focus on clean technique, along with a solid workout. We offer light to 
                    medium contact sparring, We are “Not” a full contact club. If you are interested in a full contact 
                    atmosphere we can recommend a few excellent clubs in the Hamilton area.<br /><br />
